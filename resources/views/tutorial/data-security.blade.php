    <h3>GWAS summary statistics</h3>
    <span style="font-size:18px;">
      User uploaded input file (GWAS summary statistics) is stored into the server untill the SNP2GENE process is done.
      <span style="color:blue;">Once the process is done, the input file is completely deleted. </span>
      There is no backup for user uploaded files.
    </span>
    <h3>FUMA results</h3>
    <span style="font-size:18px;">
      FUMA results are stored into the server, houever only logged in users can access to their own data.
      <span style="color:blue;">When users delete jobs, all results including the job submission recodes will be completely removed from the server.</span>
      Therefore, it is no longer possible to recover jobs which are accidentally removed.
      We recomend to download results (text files) and images as much as possible before deleting the job.
      <span style="color:red;">Even though, FUMA results are only accessible from the logged in users, we strongly recommend to remove jobs whose results need to be hightly secured.</span>
