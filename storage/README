MAGMA gene analysis and gene-set analysis were performed with MAGMA v1.6.
1. Gene analysis
  SNPs are mapped to 19436 protein coding genes (with unqiue ensembl ID) if SNPs are located within gene body.
  All parameters were set as default (SNP-wise model for gene test).
  magma.genes.out: output of gene analysis containing gene P-value
  magma.genes.raw: output of gene analysis which is used for gene-set analysis
2. Gene-set analysis
  Gene sets were obtained from MsigDB v5.2. Total of 10894 gene sets (Curated gene sets (4728) and GO terms (6166)) were tested.
  Curated gene sets consists of 9 data resources including KEGG, Reactome and BioCarta (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collection_details.jsp#C2 for details).
  GO terms consists of three categories, biological processes (bp), cellular components (cc) and molecular functions (mf).
  All parameters were set as default (competitive test).
  magma.sets.out: output of gene-set analysis containing P-value per gene set
  magma.setgenes.out: output of gene-set analysis containing all genes in each gene set
